# Contributing to Genesis 4 text video

Pull requests are welcome: bug fixes, documentation, tests, new scene ideas and tooling.

Every pull request needs an approving review from Shane Fisher (@omiron33), the code owner, before it can be merged. `main` is protected, so please work on a branch or a fork and open a pull request against `main`.

## Run it

You need Python 3.12, Pillow, and `ffmpeg` / `ffprobe` on your PATH. Rendering is CPU only.

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Freeze a song with `genesis4_video.py intake` and render with `genesis4_video.py render --intake 'intake/<id>'`. Add `--allow-draft --preview-seconds 12` for a short timing check. The README has the full intake arguments. Song recordings and renders stay out of git.

## Before you open a pull request

- Keep pull requests small and focused, and explain what you changed and how you checked it.
- For visual changes, render a still or a short clip and attach it to the pull request.
- Do not commit secrets, `.env` files, cookies, song recordings, full renders, or model weights. Large media stays out of git.
- Issues: use the bug report or feature request template.
